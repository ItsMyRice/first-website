          Hunter x Hunter is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
          Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga
          magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 1998, although the manga has
          frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have
          been collected in 37 tankōbon volumes as of November 2022. The story
          focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his
          father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned
          Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes in fantastical
          pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species,
          treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down
          lawless individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and
          eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other
          Hunters and encounters the paranormal. Hunter x Hunter was adapted
          into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and
          directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from
          October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original video animations
          (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon
          Animation and released in Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime
          television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from October
          2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated
          theatrical films released in 2013. There are also numerous audio
          albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter x
          Hunter. The manga has been translated into English and released in
          North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both television series
          have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having
          aired on the Funimation Channel in 2009 and the second series
          broadcast on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block from April 2016 to
          June 2019. Hunter x Hunter has been a huge critical and financial
          success and has become one of the best-selling manga series of all
          time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022.

          Written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, the Hunter x Hunter
          manga began its serialization in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine
          Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 3, 1998. Shueisha has compiled most of the
          chapters into individual tankōbon volumes. The first volume was
          released on June 4, 1998. As of November 4, 2022, thirty-seven volumes
          have been released. The series has also been published in a sōshūhen
          edition that aims to recreate the manga as it was originally
          serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump in the same size and with the color
          pages. Eleven volumes were released between December 9, 2011, and
          April 18, 2014, covering up to the Election story arc. In April 2005,
          Viz Media began publishing the manga in English in North America. They
          market the series as part of their "Shonen Jump Advanced" line for
          older teens and young adults. Thirty-six volumes have been released in
          North America as of August 6, 2019. Viz included the Kurapika's
          Memories chapters in the December 17 and 24, 2012 issues of their
          digital English magazine Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha. On April 22, 2014,
          it was announced that Hunter x Hunter would be joining the digital
          English magazine Weekly Shonen Jump. The manga has also been licensed
          and translated into multiple languages throughout Europe and other
          parts of Asia. For instance, it was serialized between 2001 and 2005
          in Banzai!, a German version of Weekly Shōnen Jump. Kurapika's
          Memories (クラピカ追憶編, Kurapika Tsuioku-hen), also known as "volume
          0", a two-part manga Togashi wrote to act as a prequel to the first
          animated film, Phantom Rouge, was published in the December 3 and 10,
          2012 issues of Weekly Shōnen Jump. One million copies of the volume
          were given to the first movie-goers. Tokyo Ghoul author Sui Ishida
          created a 69-page storyboard of a manga chapter depicting the past of
          Hunter x Hunter's Hisoka. The storyboard was released digitally via
          Shōnen Jump+ on June 2, 2016.

    <h2>Anime</h2>
    <div class="anime">
      <h4>1999 series</h4>
      <div class="anime-1">
        <p>
          The first Hunter x Hunter anime adaptation was produced by the company
          Nippon Animation and directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who had
          previously directed the Rurouni Kenshin television series. A total of
          62 episodes of Hunter x Hunter were broadcast on the Japanese
          terrestrial television network Fuji Television from October 16, 1999
          to March 31, 2001 during the same Saturday evening timeslot as the
          anime version of Togashi's previous series YuYu Hakusho. Additionally,
          Hunter x Hunter has aired on the satellite television station Animax.
          Although it closely follows the manga, the violence in the anime
          version is lessened for younger audiences. Marvelous Entertainment has
          released all episodes of the series in Japan on DVD in 13 separate
          volumes between September 20, 2000 and September 19, 2001. Viz Media
          licensed the Hunter x Hunter anime for distribution in the Region 1
          market, with English voice-work handled by the Ocean Group at Blue
          Water Studios in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The series was released on
          four DVD boxed sets from December 9, 2008, to December 1, 2009.
          Starting with the second set, Viz partnered with Warner Home Video to
          distribute the DVDs. Hunter x Hunter began airing in the United States
          on the Funimation Channel in the spring of 2009. When the Hunter x
          Hunter anime covered most of its source material by 2001, Nippon
          Animation made the decision to end the adaptation rather than continue
          it with filler. Due to fans' unsatisfied reactions to the conclusion
          of the television series, three subsequent OVAs were produced by
          Nippon Animation. These carried the plot from where the broadcast left
          off during the Yorknew City arc and covered the Greed Island arc. The
          first OVA series was directed by Satoshi Saga and ran for eight
          episodes in four released volumes from January 17 to April 17, 2002.
          The second OVA series, Hunter x Hunter: Greed Island, was directed by
          Yukihiro Matsushita and ran for eight episodes in four released
          volumes from February 19 to May 21, 2003. The third OVA series, Hunter
          x Hunter: G.I. Final, was directed by Makoto Sato and ran for 14
          episodes in seven released volumes from March 3 to August 18, 2004.
          After the original anime's initial run on Animax, the OVAs were aired
          successively. Viz has shown no intention of releasing English versions
          of the OVAs.

      <h4>2011 series</h4>
      <div class="anime-1">
        <p>
          This new Hunter x Hunter anime was announced on July 24, 2011. It is a
          complete reboot starting from the beginning of the original manga,
          with no connection to the first anime television series from 1999.
          Produced by Nippon TV, VAP, Shueisha and Madhouse, the series is
          directed by Hiroshi Kōjina, with Atsushi Maekawa and Tsutomu Kamishiro
          handling series composition, Takahiro Yoshimatsu designing the
          characters and Yoshihisa Hirano composing the music. Instead of having
          the old cast reprise their roles for the new adaptation, the series
          features an entirely new cast to voice the characters. The new series
          premiered airing weekly on Nippon TV and the nationwide Nippon News
          Network from October 2, 2011. The series started to be collected in
          both DVD and Blu-ray format on January 25, 2012. Viz Media has
          licensed the anime for a DVD/Blu-ray release in North America with an
          English dub. On television, the series began airing on Adult Swim's
          Toonami programming block on April 17, 2016, and ended on June 23,
          2019. The anime series' opening theme is alternated between the song
          "Departure!" and an alternate version titled "Departure! -Second
          Version-" both sung by Galneryus' vocalist Masatoshi Ono. Five pieces
          of music were used as the ending theme; "Just Awake" by the Japanese
          band Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas in episodes 1 to 26, "Hunting for
          Your Dream" by Galneryus in episodes 27 to 58, "Reason" sung by
          Japanese duo Yuzu in episodes 59 to 75, "Nagareboshi Kirari" also sung
          by Yuzu from episode 76 to 98, which was originally from the anime
          film adaptation, Hunter x Hunter: Phantom Rouge, and "Hyōri Ittai" by
          Yuzu featuring Hyadain from episode 99 to 146, which was also used in
          the film Hunter x Hunter: The Last Mission. The background music and
          soundtrack for the series was composed by Yoshihisa Hirano.

            Gon is the protagonist from Yoshihiro Togashi's manga series Hunter
            x Hunter. A young boy, Gon discovers that his father, who left him
            at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed
            professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as
            locating rare or unidentified animal species, treasure hunting,
            surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals.
            Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his
            father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and
            encounters the paranormal. Togashi originally created Gon as an
            ideal son. However, the way he saw his backstory in retrospect made
            him change his characterization as Gon instead comes across as a
            selfish teenager for the way he starts his quest. Several voice
            actors have voiced Gon across his appearances in animated
            adaptations of Hunter x Hunter and has often appeared in film
            adaptations. Critical response to Gon's character has been well
            received with critics praising his character development, design and
            several actions across the series that made him unique.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Killua is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful and mischievous
            kid who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. His ruthlessness and
            aptitude in killing show the other side of him — deadly, violent,
            and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of
            assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and
            conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and
            overall pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by
            killing an opponent due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he
            attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by
            eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial. Killua and
            Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit
            Krueger. He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island,
            helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special
            abilities to heal the dying Gon. As Gon is about to meet Ging,
            Killua decides to part ways and travel the world with Alluka.
            Conflicting with Killua's predisposition to kill is his unyielding
            loyalty to his new friends, as Killua puts them before himself
            without a single complaint. His greatest flaw is initially his fear
            of those seemingly more powerful than him, a result of Illumi's
            instructions to be extremely cautious and only engage in combat if
            victory is absolutely certain. Showing great promise from birth, he
            possesses extraordinary agility and strength as a one-man killing
            machine. Killua has mastered many killing techniques at a tender age
            and is set to be one of the best assassins his family has ever
            produced. His Nen type is Transmutation, which he utilizes by
            altering his aura into electricity. His Hatsu involves various uses
            of electricity to increase his physical capabilities, such as
            Godspeed, which allows him to move at immeasurable speeds. Killua is
            a popular character with fans, coming in first place in the series'
            first two popularity polls.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Kurapika is the sole survivor of the Kurta Clan, a race with
            treasured irises that turn scarlet in times of anger or emotional
            turmoil. Four years before the series, the entire Kurta clan was
            eradicated by a criminal group known as the Phantom Troupe, who
            desecrated the Kurta's bodies by stealing their scarlet eyes,
            thereafter selling them on the black market. He participates in the
            Hunter Exam alongside Gon, Leorio and Killua in order to become a
            Blacklist Hunter and gain the resources to take vengeance for his
            people and retrieve their eyes. Despite his morals, Kurapika is not
            above adjoining himself to society's underworld, he aligns himself
            with the Nostrade mafia family as soon as the opportunity presents
            itself, and soon becomes head of Nostrade's bodyguards. Normally
            intelligent, quick-thinking and levelheaded, upon sight of a spider,
            the symbol of the Phantom Troupe, he becomes enraged. He kills
            Uvogin, causes Pakunoda's death, and seals Chrollo Lucilfer's Nen.
            He is later invited to join the Zodiacs as the "Rat" at Leorio's
            recommendation, and only accepts upon being told that Tserriednich
            Hui Guo Rou has the last batch of eyes that he needs to retrieve.
            This leads to his accompanying Woble Hui Guo Rou to the Dark
            Continent as her bodyguard. Kurapika's Nen type is Conjuration.
            However, when his eyes turn scarlet, he becomes a Specialist. He
            conjures a unique weapon five chains, extending from each finger on
            his right hand. His ring finger, Dowsing Chain: The Guiding Ring
            Finger, has a ball on the end used for dowsing and normal defensive
            and offensive purposes. Kurapika entered into a Nen contract for the
            chain on his middle finger, Chain Jail: The Restraining Middle
            Finger; in order to have an unbreakable chain that will fully
            incapacitate members of the Phantom Troupe, he offered his life
            should he use it on anyone other than its members. His thumb chain,
            Holy Chain: Healing Thumb, heals any injury with the crucifix on the
            end. His little finger, Judgement Chain: Arbiter Little Finger,
            stabs an enemy's heart, allowing Kurapika to issue a command, which
            kills the enemy if not followed. His index finger, Thieving Index
            Finger: Steal Chain, uses the syringe on the end to extract
            someone's aura and Nen ability. His specialist ability, Emperor
            Time: Absolute Mastery, allows him to utilize 100% of all types of
            Nen but shortens his lifespan by one hour every second he uses it.
            When he uses his index finger with Emperor Time activated, it turns
            into Stealth Dolphin: Index Finger in Emperor Time, a dolphin-like
            figure only he can see that allows him to use the stolen ability,
            informing him on its basic details, and grant the stolen ability to
            someone else for a single use.

            Leorio is a teen that looks like a young adult who befriends Gon,
            Kurapika and Killua during the Hunter Exam. After losing a friend to
            a curable illness he could not afford the treatment for, Leorio
            decides to become a Hunter, seeking the large financial gains of the
            profession to become a doctor and treat the impoverished for free.
            Though he is often outshone by the genius combat abilities of Gon
            and Killua, Leorio is rather talented. After becoming a licensed
            Hunter, Leorio assists his friends in their encounter with the
            Phantom Troupe from the sidelines. He resurfaces while Gon is
            hospitalized and enters the running to become the next Chairman of
            the Hunter Association, finishing in second place. Leorio is later
            invited to become a member of the Zodiacs as the "Boar" and joins
            their expedition to the Dark Continent. When the Black Whale finally
            sets sail, Leorio starts working at the medical facility on the
            third deck under Cheadle Yorkshire. Killua suspects that Leorio's
            Nen type is Emission after seeing him teleport a punch across a room
            with a wormhole. Leorio is a popular character with fans, coming in

          </ul>
          <p>
            Hisoka is a magician and serial killer who combines magic tricks
            with violence, and delights in battling those he considers strong to
            the point of sexual arousal. He is deceitful, playful, and
            narcissistic by nature, acting only in his own self-interest. In the
            manga, his sentences typically end with a suit symbol. Hisoka takes
            an interest in Gon and his friends after encountering them during
            the Hunter Exam, letting them live so that they grow into more
            worthy opponents. Although he is initially positioned as an
            antagonist due to his affinity towards murder, he occasionally acts
            as a comrade to Gon, when it suits his own interests. Hisoka is
            revealed to be member number four of the Phantom Troupe, although he
            only joined for a chance to fight their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer. He
            leaves the group when Chrollo's Nen is sealed by Kurapika and sets
            out to find a way to break the seal. Having succeeding in this task,
            Hisoka dies after fighting Chrollo in Heavens Arena, but revives
            himself, and goes on a killing rampage against the Phantom Troupe.
            Hisoka is currently believed to be on board the Black Whale, where
            he is being hunted by the Phantom Troupe and the Xi-Yu and Cha-R
            mafia families. Hisoka's Nen type is Transmutation, allowing him to
            change the type or properties of his aura. He most often uses
            Elastic Love - Bungee Gum, which gives his aura the properties of
            both rubber and gum. He also uses Flimsy Lies - Texture Surprise,
            which allows him to reproduce the texture of his choice on any flat
            surface; such as making a handkerchief appear to be skin. Hisoka is
            a popular character with fans, coming in fourth and fifth place in
            the series' first two popularity polls.

            Isaac is the Chairman of the Selection Committee for the Hunter
            Exam. Presiding over it, he has final authority over every stage of
            the examination and is assisted by his secretary Beans, who helps
            organize the Hunter Exam and presents the successful candidates with
            their license. Netero claims to have been the strongest Nen user in
            the world over 50 years ago. Over 60 years ago, Netero spent four
            years rigorously training every day in order to express gratitude to
            the martial arts. He eventually attained enlightenment, giving him
            the ability to punch faster than the speed of sound and the power of
            the bodhisattva Guanyin.[ch. 265] Netero is also the Grand Master of
            the Shingen-Ryu style of Kung fu. Netero leads the team hired to
            exterminate the Chimera Ants, but after losing an arm and a leg and
            unable to inflict any significant damage on Meruem, he commits
            suicide by detonating The Poor Man's Rose bomb implanted in his own
            body. Survivors of the bomb's blast are eaten alive from the inside
            by poison, and can contaminate others. Isaac Netero is the father of
            Beyond Netero, whose existence was kept secret until his death.

          <p>
            Illumi is Killua's eldest brother, an experienced and expert
            assassin who played a part in Killua's training and upbringing. He
            and his father raised Killua to thrive on killing and to be
            incapable of friendship, although Illumi planted a needle in
            Killua's brain to compel him to flee from unwinnable fights as his
            way of protecting him. During the 287th Hunter Exam, using special
            pins to change his facial structure, disguising himself as
            Gittarackur, Illumi became a licensed Hunter and possibly
            manipulated Killua into disqualifying himself. After learning of and
            removing Illumi's needle from his brain, Killua later acts against
            his brother when he attempts to kill their sibling Alluka for the
            good of their family. Illumi also has a complex friendship with
            Hisoka, being hired by him to join the Phantom Troupe as their
            number 11 and kill him. Illumi is a Manipulation-type Nen user and
            his Nen ability allows him to use his needles to manipulate corpses
            or alter his body form. His other Nen ability is called Needle
            People, giving him the ability to manipulate people with his
            needles. Illumi came in sixth and eighth place in the series' first
            two popularity polls.

          <p>
            Chrollo is the founder and leader of the Phantom Troupe, bearing the
            number 0, and is considered by its members as irreplaceable despite
            putting the Troupe before himself. Surprisingly, Chrollo is right in
            the middle in terms of the Troupe's physical strength, at seventh
            place. Chrollo led the genocide of the Kurta Clan, which resulted in
            its sole survivor Kurapika vowing to punish all of the Spiders.
            After meeting in Yorknew City, Chrollo is afflicted by Kurapika's
            ability which forbids the use of his own Nen as well as any contact
            with his subordinates. Some time later, Hisoka acquires an exorcist
            to remove Kurapika's seal in order to finally challenge Chrollo to a
            fight. Chrollo wins the match and seemingly kills him. After Hisoka
            reveals himself to still be alive and begins killing off members of
            the Troupe, he and the rest of the Spiders board the Black Whale.
            His Nen type is Specialization and his ability Skill Hunter:
            Bandit's Secret allows him to directly steal and use the abilities
            of other Nen users, which he stores in a Conjured book. Chrollo came
            in fourth place in the series' second popularity poll.

          <p>
            The Zoldyck Family is considered by and far the deadliest assassins
            in the Hunter x Hunter world. The family owns and lives at Kukuroo
            Mountain, a dormant volcano in the Dentora region of the Republic of
            Padokia which stands 3,772 meters. Their estate is surrounded by
            huge stone walls guarded by a giant dog named Mike and attendants
            highly skilled in martial arts. Only few people unrelated to the
            family have any idea what is within the estate. There are a lot of
            mysteries surrounding the Zoldyck family; a single photo of any of
            the members can be sold for millions. Children in the family are
            trained from birth in the art of assassination, although each member
            of the family has the privilege to choose the specialty of their
            forte and liking as they grow up. For example, the oldest child
            Illumi seems to be a master of disguise; whereas the next oldest,
            Milluki, is a computer wizard and an expert hacker. In every
            generation, there appears to be a prodigy child whom would be named
            as their heir. Currently, the heir to the Zoldyck business is
            Killua, one of the main characters in Hunter x Hunter, though Killua
            has stated that he has no desire to inherit his family's occupation.
            It is believed that each member of Zoldyck's family begun their
            training from their date of birth. The children are also allowed the
            use of weaponry (pins, bombs, yo-yos, and paper) which are also
            suited in the Nen abilities. Members are acquired to use a special
            transmitter used in their assassination business. They possess a
            unique set of talents: resistance to almost all types of poison, the
            ability to tolerate high amounts of electricity, and immense
            strength (Killua was able to open a 16-ton door before receiving any
            form of Nen training). The members of the family who have silver
            hair: Zeno, Silva and Killua, are all Transmuters. While those with
            black hair: Kikyo, Illumi, Milluki and Kalluto, are all
            Manipulators. Maha and Alluka are the only exceptions.

          <p>
            Kite is the very first Hunter introduced in the story. A student of
            Ging Freecss, Gon's father, he traveled to Whale Island three years
            prior to the start of the series looking for leads in order to pass
            his final test, find Ging. After saving Gon from a foxbear, Kite
            revealed to him that his father is alive and the best Hunter there
            is, inspiring Gon to follow in his father's footsteps. After
            completing Greed Island Gon runs into Kite again, who, after finding
            Ging, is in the middle of a biological survey searching for new
            species in the country of Kakin. He is leading a team of young
            would-be Hunters named Banana Kavaro, Lin Koshi, Monta Yuras,
            Podungo Lapoy, Spinner Clow, and Stick Dinner. His Nen ability is
            Mad Clown: Crazy Slots where a clown-head randomly chooses a number
            from 1 to 9 and summons respective weapons, which he can not put
            away until he uses. Kite is killed by Neferpitou and his body
            rebuilt into a manipulated puppet to train the Chimera Ants. He is
            captured by Knuckle and Shoot, with Gon vowing to save him and get
            revenge. It is later revealed that Meruem's twin sister found on the
            Queen's corpse is Kite reborn as a female Chimera Ant. Ging claims
            that Crazy Slots has a number that only comes up when Kite "really
            doesn't want to die" and suspects this is the reason he is "alive".
            While named Reina by Colt, Kite quickly matured while regaining the
            memories and personality of her former human male self and helps
            snap Gon out of his depression. Kite also forces Koala, the
            koala-humanoid Chimera Ant hitman, to become her subordinate as
            penitence for the death of a girl whose physical appearance Kite has
            assumed as a Chimera Ant. Kite came in tenth place in the series'
            first popularity poll.

            Biscuit is a Double Star Stone Hunter who Gon and Killua team up
            with in Greed Island. Although she appears to be a little girl, her
            true form is actually that of a massive and extremely muscular
            57-year-old woman several times the size. Biscuit stays in this
            young girl form because she hates her actual appearance, but
            receives a tremendous power boost when she transforms back to her
            real appearance. Her goal in Greed Island is to obtain a gem found
            only in the game, Blue Planet. She becomes Gon and Killua's second
            teacher, and is also the teacher of Wing, the man who first teaches
            Nen to Gon and Killua. After the events of Greed Island, Biscuit
            later helps Gon and Killua train for their battles against Knuckle
            and Shoot during the Chimera Ant arc. She later joins Kurapika's
            party at Killua's request during the Dark Continent arc, becoming a
            guard of prince Marayam.

            whose pupil is Zushi. He meets Gon and Killua at the Heavens Arena
            and eventually teaches them Nen. Although he initially lies to them
            about Nen, he changes his mind when they advance to the 200th floor
            of Heavens Arena, realizing they could die or be badly injured by
            the other Nen users. For the next several months he teaches them the
            basics of Nen, after which he announces they have passed the secret
            final requirement for being a Hunter. He does however somewhat fear
            their immense potential. Wing's teacher was Biscuit Krueger, who
            incidentally later becomes Gon and Killua's second teacher. Wing
            makes an appearance at Isaac Netero's funeral and at the first round
            of the 13th Hunter Chairman Election. He was last seen checking up
            on Gon at the hospital. His Nen type is Enhancement. Wing came in
            11th and 15th place in the series' first two popularity polls.

            Knuckle is a Beast Hunter and Morel's pupil. Despite appearing to be
            an aggressive man, Knuckle is very compassionate and easily moved to
            tears. He also gets along well with animals, having the habit of
            taking care of abandoned pets. Knuckle's Nen ability is Hakoware:
            Bankruptcy, Chapter Seven, where by lending some aura to his
            opponent via a punch, he attaches a small indestructible
            Nen-creature called Amortizing Power Redirector or A.P.R. for short.
            It follows the opponent wherever they go and grows each successive
            time Knuckle hits them and by 10% interest on the borrowed aura
            every ten seconds. The opponent pays Knuckle back by hitting him,
            but he will not take damage until the debt is fully paid, and if the
            aura count exceeds their total remaining aura, the opponent goes
            bankrupt. At this point A.P.R. transforms into Individual Ren
            Suppressor or I.R.S. for short, which attaches itself and forces the
            debtor into Zetsu unable to use Nen for 30 days. A drawback is that
            A.P.R. can only be activated on a single person at a time.

            Gorteau's dictator Ming Jol-ik to order a mandatory gathering of the
            entire population for a national rally, so they can secretly sort to
            find Nen users who will be used as food. They also use Pitou's
            ability to manipulate the people, forming an army of soldiers under
            their control. The Hunter Association mobilizes an extermination
            team to infiltrate the East Gorteau palace and assassinate Meruem,
            composed of a selected team of professional Hunters. Meruem takes an
            interest in strategy games, defeating champion-level players by
            learning their battle tactics after disrupting the flow of their
            playing style. However, he is unable to overcome the skill of a
            seemingly dimwitted blind girl named Komugi in Gungi, the local game
            she reigns over. As Meruem finds himself unable to beat her, he
            begins showing respect and care for Komugi while questioning his own
            violent methods of ruling. As such, the King wavers between his
            human emotions and animal instincts, ultimately deciding to
            compromise by taking over the planet for the Chimera Ants, but
            sparing humans and leaving them to live in reservations. Meruem's
            faltering leaves him vulnerable, experiencing fear for the first
            time when Netero detonates the bomb in his body as a last resort.
            Near death, Meruem survives and regenerates by feeding on the cells
            of Pouf and Youpi, acquiring their abilities as well. The King
            suffers temporary memory loss before recovering his memories of
            Komugi. But Netero's suicide attack ultimately takes Meruem's life
            due to the bomb's residual poison, spending his final moments
            playing with Komugi before dying in her arms. Meruem's Nen ability,
            Aura Synthesis, allows him to take in the aura of other creatures he
            consume, making him stronger in the process.

            Komugi is a blind girl from the Republic of East Gorteau and
            reigning world champion of Gungi, a board game created in the
            country. When Meruem took over East Gorteau he challenged numerous
            expert game players and beat them at their specialties, however,
            Komugi is the only one he is unable to beat. Komugi ends up
            influencing Meruem into becoming more human-like while her exposure
            to him awakens her ability to use Nen, improving her Gungi skills.
            During the raid on the palace of East Gorteau, Komugi is severely
            injured as a result of Zeno's ability and is healed by Pitou. After
            Meruem is fatally poisoned from Netero's bomb, she stays beside him
            during his final moments and dies herself minutes later from
            exposure to him. Nearby their hands, a white Gungi piece with
            "General" and a black Gungi piece with "Shinobi" can be seen,
            referring to the relationship between Komugi and Meruem

            Mito is the woman who raised Gon and does not want him to become a
            Hunter. Despite being Ging's cousin, Gon refers to her as his aunt
            and considers her his "real mom". Although Mito never told Gon that
            Ging was a Hunter, he grew up believing both his parents died in a
            car accident, the boy learned about it from Kite three years prior
            to the series. She later reveals to him that ten years after Ging
            left Whale Island, he returned with Gon as an infant and asked their
            grandmother to take care of him for a while, but Mito felt him unfit
            to parent and gained custody of the boy. In the 1999 version of the
            anime and novelization, Mito is made into the sister of Gon's
            mother, making Ging her brother-in-law.

            Ging is a Double Star Ruins Hunter and Gon's father and motivation
            to become a Hunter. He left Whale Island to become a Hunter before
            he turned 12 years old, only returning ten years later to ask his
            grandmother to take care of Gon for a while. But Mito felt him unfit
            to parent and gained custody of Gon, and Ging never returned again.
            He is the main creator of the Greed Island video game, and is also
            the one who captured and placed Razor in the game. A member of the
            Zodiacs, his code name is the "Boar" and he is one of the only two
            members who do not mimic their corresponding animal. At the end of
            the chairman election, Ging at last meets Gon. He tells Gon to
            apologize to Kite and about the meaning of adventure before they
            once again part ways. He then resigns from the Zodiacs and joins
            Beyond Netero's expedition to the Dark Continent, buying his way
            into second-in-command in name only. Ging claims that he does not
            want to see Gon because he is too ashamed of himself for being
            absent in Gon's life due to his own selfishness, and challenges his
            son to find him. Despite that he seems confident in Gon's abilities
            and knows him better than anyone; he knew Gon would become a Hunter
            and left a memory card for Greed Island and a recorded message with
            Mito to give to him once he did, and knew Gon would eventually
            recover from his hospitalization. All information about Ging is
            classified even in the official Hunter database. He is Kite's
            teacher and also inspired Satotz to become a Hunter. Chairman Netero
            once told Biscuit that Ging is one of the top five best Nen users in
            the world. Ging tied with Silva for 15th place in the series' first
            popularity poll.

            a code name based on a sign of the Chinese zodiac, and are tasked to
            decide the nature of Netero's succession after his death. Out of
            loyalty to the chairman, most alter their behavior, physical traits,
            and even their legal names based on the animal each represents. With
            Beyond Netero and Kakin intent on an expedition to the Dark
            Continent, the Zodiacs travel with them as chaperones hired by the
            V5, a group of the five most powerful nations of the world. They

          The Hunter x Hunter episodes and chapters are broken into several
          story arcs (collections of consecutive episodes that follow a
          particular storyline within the main plot) of which there are
          currently 8 (officially; 9 unofficially; as of December 2017). The

        <p>
          The journey begins with Gon taking a series of bizarre tests to become
          a Hunter, which includes navigating a deadly jungle, hunting other
          applicants, killing a wild boar, an extraordinarily long underground
          marathon, and making sushi. During the Hunter Exam, Gon meets and
          befriends three of the applicants, Kurapika, Killua, and Leorio. The
          series' first antagonist is also introduced as one of the applicants.
          Hisoka is a complex villain who uses playing cards as weapons and
          views Gon as an "unripe fruit" that he will take great pleasure in
          killing once he's grown up enough to present a challenge. Before the
          end of the Hunter Exam, Killua faces his brother, Illumi, who makes
          him come home before he can even finish the exam.

          Gon and Killua go to Heavens Arena, a 251-floor building where people
          compete through fighting tournaments around the clock for cash. It is
          here they meet the Kung-Fu master Wing, who teaches them about Nen, a
          chi-like energy that can be used to manifest superhuman powers. He
          teaches a young child named Zushi, who joins Gon and Killua to fight
          in the tournament to gain money and experience. Hisoka is also in the
          tournament. Gon finally gets to battle Hisoka again, to show off how
          much he has improved.

          Meanwhile, Kurapika works as a bodyguard for Neon Nostrade, a flesh
          collector and daughter to the head of a Mafia family, in order for him
          to get closer to his clan's Scarlet Eyes which are set to be auctioned
          in the same city. The Phantom Troupe, a group of thieves, who had

          returning the focus to Gon and Killua. Gon and Killua are able to join
          a team hired by the billionaire, Battera, to play the game. Gon and
          Killua are joined and later Nen-trained by Biscuit Krueger, a
          57-year-old woman who looks like a 12-year-old girl, and is a master
          and experienced teacher of Nen. As the story progresses, a player
          nicknamed the Bomber is blowing other players up. Gon, Killua, and
          Biscuit team up with other players and take the Bomber out. The
          Phantom Troupe also travels to Greed Island, looking for a Nen-remover
          to remove the Nen blade on Chrollo Lucilfer, put by Kurapika to null
          his powers.

          beach. Genetic testing determines that the leg belongs to an
          abnormally large Chimera Ant Queen, which just happens to wash up on
          the shore of an island called the NGL (Neo-Green Life). The Chimera
          Ants proceed to wipe most of the population out and spawn hundreds of

          Gon using the Nen ability of Alluka Zoldyck. Illumi, aided by Hisoka,
          attempts to stop Killua due to the potential dangers attached to using

          was released on July 23rd, 2014. It can currently be viewed on Prime
          Video and Vudu. The movie takes place after the Greed Island arc at
          the start of the Chimera Ant arc while Gon and Killua were exploring
          with Kite, and may or may not be a part of the canon story-line due to
          lack of official statements.

        <p>
          is the first movie based on Yoshihiro Togashi's Hunter x Hunter,
          directed by Yuzo Sato and scripted by Shoji Yonemura. The movie
          premiered on January 12th, 2013 and a novel version was published on
          January 15th, 2013. A Japanese Blu-ray/DVD of the movie was released
          on July 24th, 2013. The movie can currently be viewed on the Vudu,
          Prime Video, and Apple TV streaming services. The movie includes a
          canon flashback of Kurapika's childhood adapted from the special
          chapters Kurapika's Memories One and Two, which was a manuscript
          written by Yoshihiro Togashi that he eventually ended up scrapping
          from the main story. The plot of the movie itself is considered
          filler. The movie is supposed to take place at the end of Yorknew City
          Arc (after episode 58 of the 2011 anime adaptation), but it has some
          changes that contradict the previous episodes and its ending don't fit
          with the next episodes of the anime. That being said, if one watches
          the movie between Yorknew City Arc and Greed Island Arc it still won't
          make sense canonically, but it is where it was supposed to be set.
